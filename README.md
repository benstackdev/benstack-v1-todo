# benstack-v1

A minimal tech stack for full stack web development that tries to strike a balance between using popular, modern, and minimal tooling. Created and used by BenStack.

## Getting started:
To get started, clone this repo and run `pnpm install` inside the root directory. You also may want to rename the package name in the root `package.json` to your project's name.

Create a `.env`, and use `.env.example` as a guide for the necessary environemnt variables to define. `.gitignore` is already configured to ignore `.env`.

## Development:
```
# Start development (both web and api)
pnpm run dev

# Start web app (frontend)
pnpm run dev:web

# Start api app (backend)
pnpm run dev:api

# Build both web and api apps
pnpm run build

# Build just web app
pnpm run build:web

# Build api app
pnpm run build:api
```

## Stack contents:
| App | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `web` | A basic React + Vite app (includes Tailwind for styles) |
| `api` | Hono app (like Express but nicer syntax and modern) |

| Packages | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `db` | Basic Drizzle ORM connected to a Postgres database (locally for now) |
| `shared` | Zod schemas and types |
| `api-client` | Layer between `web` and `api` apps to handle HTTP fetches and errors |
